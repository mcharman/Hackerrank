When you select a contiguous block of text in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted 
with a blue rectangle. In a new kind of PDF viewer, the selection of each word is independent 
of the other words; this means that each rectangular selection area forms independently 
around each highlighted word.
In this type of PDF viewer, the width of the rectangular selection area is equal to the number 
of letters in the word times the width of a letter, and the height is the maximum height of 
any letter in the word.
Consider a word consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters, where each letter is  wide. 
Given the height of each letter in millimeters, find the total area that will be highlighted by 
blue rectangle in mm when the given word is selected in our new PDF viewer.

Input Format
The first line contains 26 space-separated integers describing the respective heights of each 
consecutive lowercase English letter. 
The second line contains a single word, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters.

Constraints
1 <= h <= 7 where h is an English lowercase letters height.
Word contains no more than 10 letters.

Coutput Format
Print a single integer denoting the area of highlighted rectangle when the given
word is selected.  The unit of measurement for this is square millimeters,
but you must only print the integer.
