Watson gives two integers (A and B) to Sherlock and asks if he can count the number of square
integers between A and B (both inclusive).
*NOTE* A square integer is an integer which is the square of any integer. For example; 1, 4, 9
and 16 are some of the square integers as they are squares of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow, each in a new line.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers denoting A and B.

Constraints

1 <= A <= B <= 10^9

Output Format
For each test case, print the required answer in a new line.
