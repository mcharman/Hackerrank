Watson gives Sherlock an array A of length N.  Then he asks him to determine if there exists
an element in the array such that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of
the elements on its right.  If there are no elements to the left/right, then the sum is 
considered to be zero.

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.  For each test case, the first line contains
N, the number of elements in the array A.  The second line for each test case contains N space-
separated integers, denoting the array A.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^5

Output Format
For each test case print 'YES' if there exists an element in the array, such that the sum of the
elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right; otherwise print 'NO'
